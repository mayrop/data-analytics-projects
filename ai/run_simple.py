    Simple Agent
    Purpose: This agent is used as an ideal baseline to find the optimal path under ideal circumstances. 

    Requirements:
    - Sensors: Oracle (i.e. youâ€™re allowed to read the location of all object in the environment e.g. using env.desc)
    - Actions: Discrete and noise-free.
    - State-space: Fully observable a priori
    - Rewards/goal: Fully known a priori (you are allowed to inform the problem with the rewards and location of terminal states)
