  Random Agent
  Solution for an agent without sensory input which takes random actions. 

  Purpose: This agent should be used as a naive baseline.
  Requirements:
  - Sensors: None (/random/full; it doesnâ€™t matter...)
  - Action: Discrete
  - State-space: No prior knowledge (i.e. it has not got a map)
  - Rewards/goal: No prior knowledge (does not know where the goal is located)
